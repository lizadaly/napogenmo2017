Entry for <a href="https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2017/">National Poem Generation Month 2017</a>

Using PyTorch, I trained a recursive neural network character-by-character on a collection of 75 public domain naturalist guides and essays, and directed it to produce new sentences favoring one starting letter. The "final" poem below is a composite of several runs, with small edits applied to punctuation and a few stray words removed:

## No solitude in the caves of spring

<blockquote>
Ants and all ages are all about—active as<br/>
buds are bound by black, bubbles burn by maple blackbird body,
but burst before birds before building branches back.
<br/><br/>
Creatures—clearly considered—carved colors, covered curves,
comparatively called cheerful, conveniences containing changing, crowding companions.<br/>
Distinct, and the deeper distance of the sea which they do not describe.
<br/><br/>
Earth exhausted every egg, else entered existence with enough effort (except each early evolution), so everywhere is edible.<br/>
Fight for flowers from far—for they feed.<br/>
Glaciers grew in the gloomy gardens; grow to note that grave glade, that ally, but growing grasses gracefully between glared grassy green-gray.
<br/><br/>
Here, however, he had happened; here he had held her hidden hands.<br/>
It is seen in its present strange way, in its considerable<br/>
joy, in every picture just before and just in June between the joining season, which they judge to<br/>
kill the stars, as we know that the knowledge knows a kind of evening, of keen keep in kind.
<br/><br/>
Land straight, like legs looking,<br/>
many miles with more sharp mountains, and making more that the most moment may be ever found between, as being much of houses as me that the mind be made or strangers at my bright market.<br/>
No nation, nor new notes, now never needed, not noticed,  nor necessary near the nose of nature.
<br/><br/>
Occasionally an old olive on one of our own spring, observed only once, only over others,<br/>
pressed plants perched pictures. Pale peaks pouring: the palm-trees that proved place placed performance, provided part pebbles and passes perfect; but perhaps principally preserve perpetual poets.
<br/><br/>
Quickly, quieted, quite: and the birds resemble the system of quails but if they quest, we too but so with its question—<br/>
River: of recognizing rivers, referring reflecting and returning (related to recognition) rolled round right roots.
<br/><br/>
Some species spring several, some so short, strange strains.<br/>
There the tall third thing! There they travel, the trees through till they too, top them.
<br/><br/>
Upward to us, used upon us, uncommonly useful unless unable under with sometimes, usually, unfortunately, it's under a uniform united universe.
<br/><br/>
Variations of very various volumes, natural visitors, have ended from the vast valleys<br/>
when we were wanting, when we were without wide wild waters.
<br/><br/>
XVII
<br/><br/>
You are the part of the great season, and you have been seen many years and from  far way to your present beauty that is much in your<br/>
zest, and one that then failed to cry with them over the nervous world.
</blockquote>

## Notes

Unsurprisingly, the model had a lot of trouble finding sentences to start with X, and after a while of trying to get it to output _xylophone_ or whatever I let it do what it wanted, which was to give me a Roman numeral section break.

More surprising to me (though obvious in retrospect) was how hard it was to get a good A— sentence, as there are just too many opportunities to produce long sequences of "and a as also." P— and B— produced some of the longest intelligible sequences.

The title comes from my favorite single line generated by the model, some unrestricted text it output during training:

> Little pine sparrow—he was so high up in the fine land, but we have no solitude in the caves of spring.

I also liked:

> Possibly pierced, perhaps part potato.

## Raw output

The best poems tended to be emitted after just a few epochs; after that the output becomes boring as it predicts the most common words all the time ("One of over of on ore").

Here's an unedited run from its moments of peak creativity:

<blockquote>

(I do not know why it got so excited about elves.)
